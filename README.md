# camEvents
Nodejs backend and small bootstrap/jQuery frontend to run on raspi/docker which provides a table view of camera events - created by our ESP32 camera

This is a package to provide an investigate and view section for survival camera recorded images based on motion detection on https://github.com/areisenb/musicDir. 

# Topology

# Backend

# Frontend
is a simple bootstrap/jQuery web page (not looking too nice) which is served by the nodejs backend as described above. 
The frontend should be embedded with a series of other pages as an iframe in something like a container which serves the header and navigation menu.
